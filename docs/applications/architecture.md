The suite of Talawa applications makes the management of community-based organizations easier. There are three major components:

1. Talawa-API
1. Talawa
1. Talawa-Admin

### Talawa API
This is the heart of the Talawa applications. It governs access to the database of society's users.

### Talawa
This is the mobile app used by members of an organization. It helps create closer interactions through features such as a newsfeed, events, and chat.

### Talawa Admin
The admin web portal manages all the administrative functions necessary for Talawa to work smoothly. It includes the management of,
1. Members
1. Events
1. Newsfeeds
1. Plugins for donations and more.

In the future, we'd like this application to include reservation facilities for events.

### Architecture

This diagram outlines how the three Talawa components interact.
